### project breakdown

This projects main objective was to create a simple programming language in python. I decided to add some fun to this and create a random trivia board while also initializing it as a program lanugage. This program takes in I/O in the command line interface inorder to get this objective done. To get an output all you need to do is type a number out with its letter values not its numerical and a funny trivia will output!
