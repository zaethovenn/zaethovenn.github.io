### Task

The research question we focused for this project is what is Lyme disease, how is it caused, and what relation, if any, does it have to other diseases?

### Solution

The tool that would help us in understanding more about Lyme disease is called Laverne. Developed by Novus Biological, LLC - a company based in Centennial, Colorado that develops, licenses, and markets research materials for the scientific market. Laverne is a ‚Äúvirtual research assistant, librarian, and data cruncher‚Äù (Novus Biological). It will allow us to browse unbiased, bioinformatics data related to our gene, pathway, or disease of interest. In our case, that would be the Lyme Borreliosis. Laverne can also then provide an understanding of the biological neighborhoods in our research space. We used this tool to further understand everything we could about Lymes disease and our findings is on the final report.
