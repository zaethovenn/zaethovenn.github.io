### Task

Our concept for this project was to code a blockchain based voting machine. Features of this voting machine includes being easy-to-use and anonymous voting for the user. Our use of a blockchain data structure relates us to the concept of cryptocurrency-related technology. 

### Solution

This helps solve the problem that society recently went through with the most recent election. In said election, our former president claims there to be an abundance of voter fraud. Even though said voter fraud might not have taken place, our prototype for a better voting system that can help prevent said claims from even occurring.
