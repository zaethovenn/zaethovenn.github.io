#### Who is Zackery?

This portfolio encompasses the being of who I am and shall provide a deeper understanding in what I have accomplished and can accomplish for the future.

Some background on myself, I was born on the islands of Hawaii in honolulu but found my foundation years (k-6th grade) in Egg Harbour Township, New Jersey, inorder to be closer to family. During my years of highschool, I attended Kapolei Highschool on the westside of Oahu, where I found my interest in computer science. I graduated with a 3.88, magna cum laude, and blood cord from donating blood atleast four times. 

My academic journey has brought me to allegheny college were I completed 3 and a half years worth of college. I am a computer science major with an economics minor paired with it. 

During my time in highschool I found some entrepreneurship spirit in myself. In order to make food money to feed myself while skating around the streets of kapolei, I offered a shoe cleaning service. I took peoples dirty shoes and spit shine them until they look as new as can be. Eventually, I evolved it into a sneaker refurbishing and reselling business I ran throughout college and continue to do. I found I enjoyed running and managing my own business even at this small scale. I dream of owning a large scale business and being able to live comfotably off something I created. 

Hobbies and interests that I enjoy are as follows. I have been playing lacrosse since the age of 9 and continue to play collegiately at allegheny college. Also I am an avid hooper since middle school. If im not hooping, playing lacosse, weightlifting or videogames; I am skateboarding or surfing at the beach. I have many passions that always continue to grow.
